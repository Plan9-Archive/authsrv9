# status

should work, using it on local network.  see the manual page and
the todo-list below for caveats.


# intro

this provides a plan 9 authentication service (auth/authsrv) for
unix.  it is plain c and does not depend on external libraries.  it
currently only works on openbsd as far as i know, due to its des
library being used.  in the future, there will likely be a version
in limbo.


# install

for the unix code:
execute "make".  see the manual page authsrv9.8 for more information.


# latest version

get it from http://www.ueber.net/code/r/authsrv9


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- find standard des lib that is available on all unixes.  or include the code.
- cleanup, finish & include the limbo version.
- do a thorough security review
